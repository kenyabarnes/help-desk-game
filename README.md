### Installing

After downloading the `help-desk.rar` file, extract the contents and then double-click `help-desk.unity` to play the game!

## üéà Controls <a name="controls"></a>

There will be characters coming to your help-desk to drop of items that they found, or retreive items that they've misplaced.

* Characters that have found an item will give them to you, drag the item into the slots on the inventory to move on to the next character
* Characters that are looking for an item will describe the item to you, drag the item from the inventory to the drop-off zone next to the character to give them the item
* If you do not have the item in your inventory, you can tell the character that you don't have the item by pressing the "I don't have it!" button above your inventory.
